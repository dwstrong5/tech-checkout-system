# WCEL Tech Inventory Management System
## Don Strong, Tech & Data System

## Introduction

As of September, 2023 Whatcom Center for Early Learning (WCEL) has grown rapidly and surpassed 50 employees. While this is a wonderful achievement, this has dramatically increased our inventory of tech equipment as each staff member is capable of requesting mice, keyboards, monitors, cell phones, etc. as necessary for them to effectively provide services to Whatcom County. Additionally, funding received from Washington State for Early Support for Infants & Toddlers sets strict requirements for record keeping of all technology equipment purchased using allocated funds. As the sole IT Technician at WCEL, it's my responsibility to make sure all inventory is catalogged, maintained, and distributed among staff as necessary. The purpose of this project is to aide in managing all WCEL tech equipment by maintaining all records of existing equipment, offering staff the ability to check-out equipment as needed, and notifying WCEL admin in case of equipment shortages.
